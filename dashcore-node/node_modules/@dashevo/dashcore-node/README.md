Dashcore Node
============

A Dash full node for building applications and services with Node.js. A node is extensible and can be configured to run additional services. At the minimum a node has an interface to [Dash Core (dashd) v0.12.1.x](https://github.com/dashpay/dash/tree/v0.12.1.x) for more advanced address queries. Additional services can be enabled to make a node more useful such as exposing new APIs, running a block explorer and wallet service.

## Usages

### As a standalone server

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dashevo/dashcore-node
cd dashcore-node
./bin/dashcore-node start
```

### As a library

```bash
npm install @dashevo/dashcore-node
```

```javascript
const dashcore = require('@dashevo/dashcore-node');
const config = require('./dashcore-node.json');

let node = dashcore.scaffold.start({ path: "", config: config });
node.on('ready', function() {
    //Dash core started
    dashd.on('tx', function(txData) {
        let tx = new dashcore.lib.Transaction(txData);
    });
});
```

## Prerequisites

- Dash Core (dashd) (v0.12.1.x) with support for additional indexing *(see above)*
- Node.js v0.10, v0.12, v4 or v5
- ZeroMQ *(libzmq3-dev for Ubuntu/Debian or zeromq on OSX)*
- ~20GB of disk storage
- ~1GB of RAM

## Configuration

Dashcore includes a Command Line Interface (CLI) for managing, configuring and interfacing with your Dashcore Node.

```bash
dashcore-node create -d <dash-data-dir> mynode
cd mynode
dashcore-node install <service>
dashcore-node install https://github.com/yourname/helloworld
dashcore-node start
```

This will create a directory with configuration files for your node and install the necessary dependencies.

Please note that [Dash Core](https://github.com/dashpay/dash/tree/master) needs to be installed first.

For more information about (and developing) services, please see the [Service Documentation](docs/services.md).
